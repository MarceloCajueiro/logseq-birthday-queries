## TLDR;
The repository is a public Logseq graph with the described use case for upcoming birthdays query.

## Context

I use Logseq to organize my life, and I have a personal CRM on it. Every page starting with `@` is a person. For example: `[[@Barack Obama]]`. On those pages, I use the `CRM template` below:

```
- CRM
  template-including-parent:: false
  template:: CRM
	- Birthday:: 
	  Birth-location:: 
	  Location::
	  Relationship:: 
	  Industry::
	  Vip::
	  Last-connected::
	  Email::
	  Phone::
	  LinkedIn::
	  Instagram::
	  Source::
	- ## Background
		- ### üë™ Family
		- ### üè¢ Company
		- ### ‚ô•Ô∏èÔ∏è Likes and dislikes
		- ### üìù Notes
```

A person's page should be like this:

```
Birthday:: [[Aug 4th, 1961]] 
Birth-location:: [[USA/Hawaii/Honolulu]]
Location:: [[USA/Columbia/Washington]]
Relationship:: [[Merried]]
Industry:: [[Politics]]
Vip::
Last-connected::
Email::
Phone::
LinkedIn:: https://www.linkedin.com/in/barackobama/
Instagram:: https://www.instagram.com/barackobama/
Source::

## Background
	- ### üë™ Family
		- ...
	- ### üè¢ Company
		- ...
	- ### ‚ô•Ô∏èÔ∏è Likes and dislikes
		-
	- ### üìù Notes
		- I'm a big fan.
```

To get a table view of all the upcoming birthdays, I studied Logseq's query DSL and Clojure. Working on Logseq query DSL is difficult because of the need for better documentation.

* [Here you can see the use case](https://samples.cajueiro.me/#/page/case);
* [Here you can see the queries and comments I did](https://samples.cajueiro.me/#/page/queries);
  * Sadly, the publisher has a bug since some queries are not displayed (reported [here](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/7332)). You can run this graph on your machine by:
    * [Downloading this repository](https://github.com/MarceloCajueiro/logseq-birthday-queries/archive/refs/heads/main.zip);
    * Unzipping and loading the graph on your Logseq app.

### The final query version

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{
:title "üéÇ Next birthdays üéÇ"
:query
 [:find
  ?name ?birthday ?d
  :in $ ?start ?next
  :where
  [?b :block/properties ?properties]
  [(get ?properties :birthday) ?birthday]
  [?b :block/left ?page]
  [?b :block/ref-pages ?p]
  [?p :block/journal? true]
  [?p :block/journal-day ?d]
  [?page :block/name ?name]
  [(< ?d ?next)]
  [(>= ?d ?start)]]
 :inputs [:today :30d-after]

 :view (fn [raw-people]
        (def people-count (/ (count raw-people) 3))

         (def ids (range people-count))

         (def people
           (map (fn [id]
                  (def idx (* id 3))
                  {:id id
                   :name (nth raw-people idx)
                   :birthday (nth raw-people (+ idx 1))
                   :date (nth raw-people (+ idx 2))}) ids))

         (def sorted-people (sort-by :date people))

         (def people
           (map (fn [id]
                  (def idx (* id 3))
                  {:id id
                   :name (nth people idx)
                   :birthday (nth people (+ idx 1))
                   :date (nth people (+ idx 2))}) ids))

         (defn link [path] [:a {:href (str "#/page/" path)} (str path)])

         (def rows
           (map (fn [person]
                  [:tr
                   [:td (link (get person :name))]
                   [:td (link (first (get person :birthday)))]]) sorted-people))



         [:div.table-wrapper
          [:table.table-auto
           [:thead
            [:tr
             [:th "Name"]
             [:th "Birthday"]]]
           [:tbody
            rows]]])}
#+END_QUERY
```

### Pending improvements

- [X] Sort by birthday;
- [ ] Ignore the year on the query (in the current version, it will be necessary to have the date of the next birthday and not the person's birth date;)
- [X] Create a query that can be loaded properly in the `default-queries`;
